Too Expensive to Start:

Electric Car Cost: Buying the electric car (solar panels, wind turbines) costs a lot upfront. People in developing countries often don't have that much money saved up.

No Easy Loans: Banks might not want to lend money for these new, expensive "electric cars" because they don't know much about them or think it's too risky.

No Roads or Mechanics:

Bad Roads: Even if you have an electric car, if there aren't proper charging stations or good roads (like a strong power grid), it's hard to use it.

No Repair Shops: There might not be enough people who know how to fix these new "electric cars" (install and maintain renewable tech), so if something breaks, you're stuck.

Government Habits and Rules:

Old Habits Die Hard: The government might have always supported gasoline cars (fossil fuels), making them cheaper with special deals. It's hard to change these old rules.

No Clear Rules for New Cars: There might not be clear rules or encouragement (like tax breaks) for buying "electric cars," making it harder for people to choose them over the cheaper, familiar gasoline ones.
